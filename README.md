# Hacking Notes

This repository holds notes that I'm taking as I progress in my study of ethical hacking.

## Main Sources

These notes have been taken while studying a wide array of resources, including:
- TCM Academy courses;
- HTB boxes, challenges and other labs;
- HTB academy modules;
- THM rooms and networks;
- youtube and twitch videos from various creators;
- wikipedia articles;
- man pages;
- informational pages from vendors (including, but not limited to, Microsoft);
- etc, etc, etc.

The notes that appear on this repository are not taken straight out of a single source, but they are rather a summarization of all of the sources that I consulted on each topic. As such, these notes should not be taken as indicative of the courses leading to PNPT (full disclosure: at the time of writing I haven't attempted it yet), or to the work done to root any specific HTB box or to complete any specific THM module. In particular, I'm taking great care to never mention any live HTB box or any THM content, unless first authorized by the relevant parties (which, at the time of writing, hasn't happened yet).

### DISCLAIMER

If you represent one of the sources listed above and you believe any of these notes is infringing on the rights that you represent, or if you believe that I've left details that clearly point to something that may affect the experience of your users, please get in touch with me. I will not (for very obvious reasons) post my email here, but you can open an issue on this repository clearly indicating the affected party and the specific file that presents issues and, as soon as I'll notice it, I shall reach out through the contact channels provided by the affected party on their website. Please allow a few days for me to notice and react.

Also, if you believe that there's a more efficient way to do this which doesn't expose me to inordinate amount of spam, please open an issue and suggest what you have in mind.

## PLEASE BE AWARE
